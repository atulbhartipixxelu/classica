                                Today is Classia 4th Anniversary. And I ask this question to my Team,
                                Educators, Investors and Advisors: do we want to become successful or
                                do we want to become successful and create a dent?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two types of successful organizations. Ones who become
                                successful and the ones who become successful and create a dent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ones who become successful end up creating a lot of jobs, end up
                                creating a lot of value for the team members and shareholders and most
                                importantly customers. But the ones who create a dent also have a
                                burning desire to push the industry forward. They shatter all existing
                                beliefs and create their own beliefs. They don’t just create great
                                products. They recreate the industry as we know of. Customers love
                                them and competitors fear them for their innovation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obsession and Paranoia. Obsession about giving the best experience and
                                Paranoia about the smallest of the things that can go wrong. Usually
                                both these words are associated with a negative sentiment. But the
                                world’s most successful organisations that have created a dent are
                                made by Teams that are obsessed and paranoid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When we think about obsession, Apple is the first organisation that
                                comes to the mind but Apple is not the only one. When you stay in an
                                Oberoi property you know that it’s not just successful, it’s
                                successful and it has created a dent. Managers are obsessed enough to
                                spot bathroom tiles that are minutely misaligned or table linen that’s
                                barely askew. If a guest asks for a particular brand of tea once then
                                that tea brand is served to the guest every time the guest stays at an
                                Oberoi property. The obsession comes top down. The Leaders of the
                                organisation have to take charge and become obsessed and then the team
                                follows. You will find plenty of stories of Biki Oberoi, read them and
                                you will know why Oberoi feels different than every other five star
                                hotel in the country.

                                Since the day we started our mission has been to Empower Educators and
                                make high quality education affordable and accessible. And from the
                                beginning we have always taken a different approach towards not just
                                building product but also a great organisation. At the core of the
                                organisation are the following Leadership Principles:
                            </p>

                                <li>Impatience for Action</li>
                                <li>Obsession starts with the “comma”</li>
                                <li>Showing not telling</li>
                                <li>Insist on the highest standards</li>
                                <li>Learning and Unlearning</li>
                                <li>Unconventional thinking</li>
                                <li>Overtly Transparent</li>
